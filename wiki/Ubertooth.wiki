=== dBm ===
The RSSI (received signal strength Indication) is measured in dBm which is to say 1 decibel using milliwatt as a reference. It simply is a power, or intensity measurement of the received signal from the antenna. It is a negative value with (in our case) -100 being the weakest signal strength and going _*up*_ to 0. This means that a -60dBm is stronger than a -90dBm signal, obviously. Bluetooth protocol uses a 1600x/second frequency hopping scheme across a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">spread spectrum</a>" of channels which range from frequencies: 2.400GHz to 2.485GHz

Warcarrier now has support for the Ubertooth Bluetooth (spectrum analyzer functionality only) using Dragorn's spectools. I use spectool_raw to poll the device for the raw dBm values of RSSI  levels. Here is an example of output:

{{{
-100 -97 -100 -88 -97 -99 -86 -97 -100 ... 
}}}

These values are preprocessed and dBm values according to the spectools Author himself. I take them and draw lines using the difference in (dBm_MAX - RSSI_dBm) yielding (from above output)

{{{
0 3 0 12 3 1 14 3 0
}}}

The lines are then made like so:

{{{
---              |
--         |     |
-90dBm     |     |
-          |     |
--         |     |
---        |     |
--         |     |
-95dBm     |     |
-          |     |
--         |     |
--         |     |
---      | | |   | |
--       | | |   | |
-100dBm _| | |_| | |_
        2400MHz 2406MHz ...
}}}

Then I simply reverse them into spaces with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mdxi/Curses-UI-0.9609/">Curses::UI</a>'s {{{ -reverse=>1 }}} attribute to the Label object and display them with the corresponding value to the left and a small key in the top right with color coded lines.

This gives a nice clean "zoomed" view of the spectrum, which makes finding a spectral mask tough, but is most accurate because we see _all_ values from -100dBm up to -70dBm. 

Each bar is a Curses::UI Label object, which is kind of clunky, but works. So to do this, I used simple logic/magic to convert these bars into one-line bars in a new array, which I invented with a dry-erase marker on my large bathroom mirror.

== Recording ==

In the image below we can see a sample being "recorded" of the site, or surrounding area. This logs the current GPS corrdinates and timestamp with *each* RSSI value seen by the antenna:

The log is a simple CSV file, which can then be "replayed" at any time in the future. To begin recording simply hit "*r*" and to stop hit "*r*" again. hit "*x*" at anytime to close the Bluetooth Spectrum Analysis window.

== Spectools ==
